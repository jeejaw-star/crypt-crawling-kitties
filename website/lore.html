        <h1 class="color-changing-text">Chapter 1: Creation</h1>
        <p class="color-changing-text">There was nothing, at first. A collision of cosmic energies gave birth to a form, that became the being we know as Gideon Nightcatcher. As he absorbed cosmic energy, his power grew. Eventually, he decided to create a planed. So, he wrought a perfect sphere of pure energy, which solidified. He sent pulses through it at random, creating the many dungeons. Out of clay, he wrought the First Ones: Elves. He tore many holes in space-time, stepped through, and visited many planets, collecting creatures from each one, including those annoying ghosts. Their constant whining was very irratating, and he eventually grounded them on Rathkar. He found zombies on IO, next to a huge, gassy planet. They were very cold there, so they developed an immunity to cold. However, they are also very easy to burn.</p>
